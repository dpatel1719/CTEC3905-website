                        <p id="black" class="text-center">GLAMORISER SALON RESULTS TOUCH HAIR STRAIGTNERS</p>

                        <p id="black">Hair straightening is a HUGE thing for me! I am blessed with naturally curly hair although when it comes to wearing my hair straight its always been a issue for me since a teenager! I have gone through so many brands and types
                            of hair straighteners to get smooth straight shiny hair and the only ones that work for me are my GHDs. I have super thick and long hair and many hair straighteners I have tried in the past may have straightened my hair but
                            left it frizzy and dry.</p>

                        <p id="black">However one day I was casually scrolling across my newsfeed on Facebook and I came across these Glamoriser hair straighteners so I read the comments and all of them were great but I thought no I have my GHDs which work great already.
                            Although I stumbled upon them again on Facebook and that&rsquo;s when I Googled them and they happened to be on offer at half price so therefore I just could not RESIST myself.</p>

                        <p id="black">So when I received them I had to test them out straight away! Super easy to turn on and use instantly. They heat up in less than 15 seconds and it makes a beep noise when they are ready for use. I loved how the touch screen panel
                            locks for safety and allows the temperature setting to remain to your set preference. First section of hair I straightened, these bad boys effortlessly glided through my hair without snagging or tugging on my hair and with
                            one use my hair was almost dead straight that too at only 180&deg;C, which was not even the highest setting! I ran my fingers through my hair and my hair was so smooth and looked super shiny!</p>

                        <p id="black">So that&rsquo;s when I thought lets test them out for curling surely they can&rsquo;t be so great at the price they came for,&nbsp; but I was wrong! Beautiful curls I was able to create with these straighteners and not just that
                            they lasted on me the whole day!</p>

                        <p id="black">I absolutely love these new hair straighteners I have discovered! The &lsquo;Black Diamond Oil&rsquo; infused ceramic plates leave my hair ridiculously smooth and shiny. Also they come with a gorgeous travel bag which works as
                            a heat proof mat too. The main plug also holds a European 2 pin plug inside if you unscrew the plug which I thought is so handy for taking these hair straighteners on holiday. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p id="black">I am in LOVE with these hair straighteners my angels! They are just as good as my beloved GHDs, I never thought I would be saying that but I can&rsquo;t deny how good they are! I highly recommend these to you guys, they are a BARGAIN
                            at under &pound;50!</p>

                    <h3>HAIR routine...</h3>
                </p>
                <p id="black">
                    So recently I have changed up my hair routine as I have been experiencing a lot of hair fall. Oil treatments I have been using for many years, I apply oil once a week and as you guys know I LOVE my coconut oil!
                    <br /> I recently came across ‘L’Oreal Elvive Low Shampoo’. It’s a sulphate free shampoo so like your regular shampoo it does not foam up which at first feels weird I must say. It’s like a cleansing cream for the hair. Its texture
                    is like hair conditioner and with this shampoo you do not need to use a separate conditioner which saves so much time and money I think.
                    <br /> The actual shampoo can be difficult to work with and apply as it does not lather but after a couple of uses you grasp the concept. But the main reason I have decided to write about this is because it has left my hair so nourished
                    and smooth. My hair feels and looks healthy and stronger.
                    <br /> I am really impressed with this new shampoo. However it can be a bit on the expensive side as you require a good 5-6 pumps of the shampoo for one use. I need that much to cover my long thick hair but if you have shorter hair
                    2-3 pumps is adequate. The shampoo price ranges from £5-7 so it would be good to get a couple of bottles when on offer!
                    <br /> But overall guys give it a try it’s a different experience but leaves your hair very healthy and shiny. It’s one of those hit or miss products with people but give it a try and let me know what you guys think!
